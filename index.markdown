## What's in the Box?
When you order The Green Codeck, you’ll receive a physical deck filled with actionable, energy-efficient design patterns, including:

- **50+ Energy-Efficient Design Patterns** – Each card contains a specific strategy, best practice, or tip.
- **Categories for Easy Reference** – The cards are organized into various categories, such as optimization, algorithms, and infrastructure, making it easy to find the right pattern.
- **Simple and Actionable Tips** – Quick to understand and ready to apply to your project, whether you're optimizing an existing system or building something new.
- **Sustainable Code Challenge** – A unique card that challenges you to optimize a piece of code for energy efficiency, making learning interactive and fun!

Each card in the deck is designed with sustainability in mind, giving you practical insights into reducing the environmental impact of your code.

## How It Works
The Green Codeck is available both physically and digitally. You can order the physical deck here, or explore the patterns directly on the website. Each card represents a specific best practice or approach that can be applied to your projects. The cards cover various areas of coding, from algorithm optimization to system design considerations.

In the physical version of the deck, cards can be shuffled and ordered to match your current project needs, or simply used for inspiration when you need an energy-efficient coding solution.

## Why It Matters
As software systems grow, so does their carbon footprint. The Green Codeck was created to help developers incorporate sustainability into their workflow, reducing energy consumption and lowering the overall environmental impact of their work.

By using these patterns, you'll not only improve the efficiency of your code but also contribute to a global movement toward greener technology.
