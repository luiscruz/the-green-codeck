Greening the codebase, one card at a time!

The Green Codeck is a deck of cards designed to help developers create energy-efficient code. Each card features a design pattern, tip, or strategy that can help you optimize your code and reduce its environmental impact.

Whether you are building a small application or working on a large-scale system, these patterns will guide you in making informed decisions that improve performance while saving energy. The Green Codeck empowers you to code smarter, not harder, and contribute to a more sustainable future.

## What's in the Box?
When you order The Green Codeck, you’ll receive a physical deck filled with actionable, energy-efficient design patterns, including:

- **Energy-Efficient Design Patterns** – Each card contains a specific strategy, best practice, or tip.
- **Categories for Easy Reference** – The cards are organized into various categories, such as AI, Database, UI, Cloud, DevOps, and Organization, making it easy to find the right pattern.
- **Simple and Actionable Tips** – Quick to understand and ready to apply to your project, whether you're optimizing an existing system or building something new.
- **Sustainable Code Challenge** – A unique card that challenges you to optimize a piece of code for energy efficiency, making learning interactive and fun!

Each card in the deck is designed with sustainability in mind, giving you practical insights into reducing the environmental impact of your code.

## How It Works
The Green Codeck is available both physically and digitally. You can start using it right now by [browsing the patterns](/the-green-codeck/the-patterns/) or [shuffling a random card](/the-green-codeck/shuffle/). Each card represents a specific best practice or approach that can be applied to your projects, covering areas from algorithm optimization to system design considerations.

Want a physical deck? You can pre-order one to shuffle, sort, and use in workshops or team discussions.

## Why It Matters
As software systems grow, so does their carbon footprint. The Green Codeck was created to help developers incorporate sustainability into their workflow, reducing energy consumption and lowering the overall environmental impact of their work.

By using these patterns, you'll not only improve the efficiency of your code but also contribute to a global movement toward greener technology.

## Games

The Green Codeck is not just a reference but also a tool for team learning. Here are a few games you can play with the deck.

### Green Code Review
Show a real or fictional code snippet to the group. Each player draws 3 cards and has 2 minutes to pitch how one or more of their cards can improve the code's energy efficiency. The group votes on the most impactful suggestion. Winner keeps the snippet as a point. Works well in workshops and classrooms as it forces players to connect patterns to concrete code.

### Pattern Poker
Like planning poker, but for sustainability. Describe a software scenario (e.g., "a mobile app that syncs user data every 30 seconds"). Each player secretly picks the pattern card from their hand they believe would have the biggest energy impact. Everyone reveals at the same time, defends their choice, and the group reaches consensus.

### Sustainability Quiz
One player reads a pattern's description without revealing the name. Other players race to guess the pattern. First correct answer scores a point. Bonus point if the player can name a real-world example where the pattern applies.
