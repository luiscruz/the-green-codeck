Greening the codebase, one card at a time!

The Green Codeck is a deck of cards designed to help developers create energy-efficient code. Each card features a design pattern, tip, or strategy that can help you optimize your code and reduce its environmental impact.

Whether you are building a small application or working on a large-scale system, these patterns will guide you in making informed decisions that improve performance while saving energy. The Green Codeck empowers you to code smarter, not harder, and contribute to a more sustainable future.

## What's in the Box?
When you order The Green Codeck, you’ll receive a physical deck filled with actionable, energy-efficient design patterns, including:

- **Energy-Efficient Design Patterns** – Each card contains a specific strategy, best practice, or tip.
- **Categories for Easy Reference** – The cards are organized into various categories, such as optimization, algorithms, and infrastructure, making it easy to find the right pattern.
- **Simple and Actionable Tips** – Quick to understand and ready to apply to your project, whether you're optimizing an existing system or building something new.
- **Sustainable Code Challenge** – A unique card that challenges you to optimize a piece of code for energy efficiency, making learning interactive and fun!

Each card in the deck is designed with sustainability in mind, giving you practical insights into reducing the environmental impact of your code.

## How It Works
The Green Codeck is available both physically and digitally. You can start using it right now by [browsing the patterns](/the-green-codeck/the-patterns/) or [shuffling a random card](/the-green-codeck/shuffle/). Each card represents a specific best practice or approach that can be applied to your projects, covering areas from algorithm optimization to system design considerations.

Want a physical deck? You can pre-order one to shuffle, sort, and use in workshops or team discussions.

## Why It Matters
As software systems grow, so does their carbon footprint. The Green Codeck was created to help developers incorporate sustainability into their workflow, reducing energy consumption and lowering the overall environmental impact of their work.

By using these patterns, you'll not only improve the efficiency of your code but also contribute to a global movement toward greener technology.
