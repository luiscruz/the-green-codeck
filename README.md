# The Green Codeck
Greening the codebase, one card at a time.

Welcome to the Green Codeck repository! This project provides a collection of energy-efficient software design patterns, encapsulated in a deck of cards. These patterns will help developers build sustainable, green software by guiding them to write code with a lower environmental impact.

The source code for the Green Codeck cards is hosted here, and the deck is designed to be displayed on a web-based Jekyll site for easy access and interaction.

If you want to order your deck of cards, please check the website: <https://luiscruz.github.io/the-green-codeck>
