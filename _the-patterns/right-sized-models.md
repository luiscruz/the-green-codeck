name: Right-Sized Models
category: "AI"
description: |
  Select an AI model whose complexity is appropriate for the task at hand, avoiding unnecessarily large or resource-intensive models. 
  High-capacity models like large language models (LLMs) can be energy-intensive and are often overkill for tasks that could be solved with simpler, more efficient techniquesâ€”such as symbolic rules, heuristics, or small neural networks.
  This pattern promotes using the lightest viable approach that meets functional and quality requirements, which reduces energy consumption and improves inference efficiency.
  Applying this principle early in the design phase can also encourage modular architectures that allow for model swapping based on context or constraints.
