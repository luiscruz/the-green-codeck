description: >
  Reduce energy consumption by favoring push-based communication over polling mechanisms. 
  Polling requires periodic checks for updates, which often results in unnecessary CPU and network activity—especially when no updates are available. 
  Push-based systems, on the other hand, notify clients only when new data is available, avoiding idle resource use and reducing energy waste. 
  This pattern is particularly valuable in mobile, IoT, and client-server systems where efficiency is critical.
