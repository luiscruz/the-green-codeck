name: "Disable Extra Displays"
category: "UI"
description: "Avoid activating or using secondary displays (external monitors, dashboards, or mirrored views) when they are not strictly necessary. This pattern reduces energy consumption by minimizing the number of active screens, particularly in multi-monitor setups or multi-view interfaces. It can be applied by developers (e.g., in UI configurations) or encouraged for users through defaults, recommendations, or eco-modes."
