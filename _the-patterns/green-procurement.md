description: "Select providers that are certified or demonstrate a genuine commitment to sustainable software practices.  
This pattern can be applied across all stages of the software development lifecycle.

A clear example is during infrastructure selection: when choosing a cloud provider, prioritize those using renewable energy, offering carbon transparency reports, and tracking sustainability indicators.

Another important use case, closer to the development stage, is selecting software dependencies. Some libraries conduct energy or performance testing or provide documentation on efficient API usage. Factoring in these efforts when choosing dependencies supports providers who value sustainability.

By choosing sustainable providers, we encourage and reward those who invest in greener practicesâ€”helping them gain business value from their commitment."
