  Allow users to decide how software features operate to better align with their energy, performance, or experience preferences.
  Different users have different priorities—some may need full functionality at all times, while others may prefer to optimize for battery life, performance, or sustainability. 
  Energy-intensive features—such as real-time updates, high refresh rates, or detailed visual effects—may not be necessary for every user or use case.
  By providing configurable options, software can adapt its behavior to what each user actually needs.
  This flexibility helps reduce unnecessary energy use without compromising usability for those who prioritize full functionality.
