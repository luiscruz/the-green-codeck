name: "Monitor CI Energy Usage"
category: "DevOps"
description: |
  Monitor and report the energy consumption of continuous integration (CI) and build pipelines to identify inefficiencies and reduce unnecessary usage.
  CI pipelines are often executed frequently and can become energy-intensive over time â€” especially in large teams or fast-moving projects. By tracking energy consumption, development teams can surface hotspots and take action, such as reducing redundant jobs, batching workflows, or optimizing dependency installation.

  Promoting energy transparency in CI not only helps reduce the environmental impact but also encourages a more responsible engineering culture. Reporting energy data (e.g., in dashboards or build summaries) helps teams make greener decisions in their development lifecycle.

Example: |
  Integrate tools like [Eco CI](https://www.green-coding.io/products/eco-ci/), [Scaphandre](https://github.com/hubblo-org/scaphandre), [Kepler](https://github.com/sustainable-computing-io/kepler), which provides automated energy tracking for CI pipelines in GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and Jenkins. It adds energy metrics to each pipeline run, making energy usage visible and measurable as part of the software delivery process.
