description: "Choose cloud regions that are geographically closer to your users to reduce energy consumption and hardware impact.

From an energy-efficiency perspective, shorter network distances mean fewer energy costs per transmitted packet. From an embodied carbon perspective, fewer intermediate network hops and devices mean less reliance on global infrastructure, improving hardware efficiency.

This pattern can be applied when selecting data center regions for cloud services, content delivery networks (CDNs), and edge computing setups."
