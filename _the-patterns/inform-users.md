description:  |
  Let users know when operations are battery-intensive or when energy-saving features are available. 
  A sustainable user experience involves making the trade-offs between performance and energy efficiency visible and understandable.
  Depending on context and individual preferences, users may prioritize features differently. 
  Providing clear and timely information empowers them to make informed choices that balance usability and sustainability.
  Use visual cues like badges, alerts, or contextual hints to surface this information within the interface.
