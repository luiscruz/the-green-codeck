name: Data Retention Policy
category: "Cloud"
description: >
  From an embodied carbon perspective, it is more efficient to automatically delete unused storage resources to optimize hardware usage. 
  Reducing unnecessary storage not only minimizes physical resource consumption but also ensures that the storage layer remains aligned with task requirements.
  This pattern involves setting a retention policy to automate the deletion of unused or outdated data based on predefined business needs. Not having such a policy will make it more difficult and bring more overhead for manually deleting idle resources.
