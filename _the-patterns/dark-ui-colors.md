description: "Provide a UI with dark background colors. This is particularly beneficial for mobile devices with AMOLED screens, which are more energy efficient when displaying dark colors. In some cases, it might be reasonable to allow users to choose between a light and a dark theme. The dark theme can also be activated using a special trigger (e.g., when battery is running low)."
