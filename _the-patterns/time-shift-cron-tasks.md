description: >
  Schedule workloads to run during periods of lower electricity carbon intensity in order to reduce overall software emissions. 
  The environmental impact of software depends not only on the energy it consumes, but also on the carbon intensity of the electricity grid at the time of execution.
  This pattern is especially relevant for recurring or delay-tolerant jobs such as machine learning training tasks or batch processing.
