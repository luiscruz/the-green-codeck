category: "AI"
description: |
  Use only the data that meaningfully contributes to learning, to reduce training time, energy consumption, and resource usage. 
  Large datasets can lead to unnecessary compute costs, especially when much of the data is redundant or low-value.
  Techniques like feature selection, coreset extraction, and curriculum learning can help identify the most informative examples or dimensions, enabling more efficient training without compromising model performance.
  This pattern supports leaner, faster, and more sustainable machine learning pipelines, and is especially relevant for organizations working with large-scale or continuously collected datasets.
